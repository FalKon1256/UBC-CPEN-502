# UBC - CPEN 502 - Architecture for Learning Systems (2023 Winter Session Term 1)
This project is based on Java and the Robocode platform, I have built structures of neural networks and lookup tables (LUT) with reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning) to embed it in our customized robot tank on Robocode.
To increase the win rate against sample robots with different action patterns, I tried to adjust the hyperparameters and reward mechanism, while observing how our robot interacts with the environment and its opponent. The concepts of neural networks, backpropagation, LUT, and reinforcement learning are involved in this project. 

Reference to the Robocode platform is [here](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/).
